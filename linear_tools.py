Linear tools

This section contains some rather basic implementations of linear 
time series methods which are there just for convenience. If you 
want to embark seriously on linear or spectral analysis of your 
data, you will have to use any one of the statistical or mathematics 
packages around. Please, don't judge us by the level of sophistication 
in this section!
