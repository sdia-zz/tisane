Nonlinear prediction


A number of phase space based prediction techniques are 
implemented in TISEAN. They differ in the way in which 
the dynamics is approximated. The very similar programs 
zeroth and predict use locally constant fits. This is the 
most robust approach for short, noisy signals, easy 
handling and quick answers. Further, local linear models, 
radial basis functions, and polynomial fits are provided.

For a discussion of these methods and examples see the 
corresponding section of the introduction paper.

def zeroth():

    '''
    Simple nonlinear prediction

    This program makes a zeroth order ansatz and estimates the one
    step prediction errors of the model on a multivariate time
    series. This is done by searching for all neighbors of the point
    to be forecasted and taking as its image the average of the images
    of the neighbors. The given forecast errors are normalized to the
    standard deviations of each component. In addition to using a
    multicomponent time series a temporal embedding is possible. Thus
    one has to give two dimensions. The first is the number of
    components, the second the temporal embedding. This is realized by
    giving two numbers to the option m seperated by a comma.


    Usage of the -c and -m flags

    By default the first m columns of a file are used. This behaviour
    can by modified by means of the -c flag. It takes a series of
    numbers separated by commas. The numbers represent the
    colomns. For instance -m 3,1 -c 3,5,7 means, use three components
    with no additional temporal embedding, reading columns 3, 5 and
    7. It is not necessary to give the full number of components to
    the -c flag. If numbers are missing, the string is filled up
    starting with the smallest number, larger than the largest
    given. For instance, -m 3,1 -c 3 would result in reading columns
    3, 4 and 5.

    Output:

    The output consists of s lines, each of which containing the steps
    forecasted (first column) and the relative forecast errors (next
    columns) for each component of the vector seperately. Relative
    means that the forecast error is devided by the standard deviation
    of the vector component.

    If the Verbosity level is larger than 1, the output also contains
    the individual forecast error for each component of each reference
    point.

def rbf():

    '''
    Radial basis function fit

    This program models the data using a radial basis function (rbf)
    ansatz. The basis functions used are gaussians, with center points
    chosen to be data from the time series. If the -X option is not
    given, a kind of Coulomb force is applied to them to let them
    drift a bit in order to distribute them more uniformly. The
    variance of the gaussians is set to the average distance between
    the centers.

    This program either tests the ansatz by calculating the average
    forecast error of the model, or makes a i-step prediction using
    the -L flag, additionally. The ansatz made is:

    xn+1 = a0 + SUM aifi(xn),

    where xn is the nth delay vector and fi is a gaussian centered at
    the ith center point.
